## Oh no

IntelliJ seems to have deleted some of my media files for this project, such as images, so I will have to recreate some of it. This issue happened before I started using version control for this project.

Once the files are either remade or recovered somehow, I will be able to proceed with development.

## General info

Aside from the data loss issue, you can see the code is fine. It just throws exceptions because of missing image files, such as for the player, menu, tiles, etc. 

But the basic idea is that it's a 2D grid-based RPG. So far, I have implemented 4-way player movement (with directionality, not just positions), collision detection, a main menu, an in-game menu, interactive events, multiple layers of tiles and event objects, obstacles you can't move through, graphics, and a level editor.
